## Roslyn C#

This repository is `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` project, the part of `Roslyn`

It is a Roslyn from where VB.NET compiler and unnecessary files for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` was deleted.

The original Roslyn repository is here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn

There are some C# semantic changes in the `diploma` branch which were made for my student diploma
